# NextProp - Real Estate Lead Generation Dashboard

NextProp is a comprehensive real estate lead generation platform that integrates with the Zillow API to fetch property listings and generate qualified leads for real estate agents and brokers.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Property Search**: Use natural language to describe properties you're looking for
- **City-based Search**: Find properties in specific cities
- **Lead Generation**: Add property contacts as leads with one click
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Track leads, conversions, and revenue
- **Contact Management**: View and manage all your real estate leads
- **Automated Ringless Voicemails**: Send personalized voicemails to leads without disturbing them

## Zillow API Integration

The platform integrates with the Zillow Working API to fetch property data using two main methods:

1. **City-Based Search**: Find properties in specific cities like Miami, New York, etc.
2. **AI-Powered Search**: Use natural language to describe exactly what you're looking for, such as "Houses for sale built after 2001 within price 500000, minimum lotsize 5000 sqft, 3 beds, 3 baths, in Miami Florida"

## NextProp Ringless Voicemail Integration

This project implements a ringless voicemail service for NextProp, integrating directly with the VoiceDrop API to send automated voicemails to prospects.

### VoiceDrop API Integration

The application has been updated to use VoiceDrop's API via a server-side Next.js API route, replacing the previous Make.com webhook integration. The implementation is located in:

- `src/lib/callService.ts` - Client-side service for managing calls
- `src/app/api/voicemail/route.ts` - Server-side API route to proxy requests to VoiceDrop

### Implementation Architecture

To avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues, we've implemented a proxy architecture:

1. The client-side `callService.ts` sends requests to our own Next.js API route at `/api/voicemail`
2. The server-side API route makes the actual request to the VoiceDrop API
3. This approach prevents CORS errors that would occur when calling the VoiceDrop API directly from the browser

### Webhook Implementation

The application now includes a webhook system to receive and display real-time status updates from the VoiceDrop API:

1. **Webhook Endpoint**: Implemented at `/api/webhook/voicemail` to receive callbacks from VoiceDrop
2. **Webhook Storage**: Stores the latest 50 webhook responses in memory
3. **Webhook Display**: A dedicated page at `/webhooks` shows all received webhook responses
4. **Auto-Refresh**: The webhooks page automatically refreshes every 10 seconds to show the latest updates
5. **Integration**: When sending a voicemail, a dynamic webhook URL is generated and included in the request to VoiceDrop

This webhook system provides users with real-time updates about the status of their voicemails, including delivery confirmations, failures, and processing status.

### Current Implementation

The current implementation:

1. Uses the VoiceDrop API key (`vd_L6JGDq5Vj924Eq7k7Mb1`) for authentication via the `auth-key` header
2. Sends ringless voicemails through the `/ringless_voicemail` endpoint
3. Uses the "Reey 4" voice clone (ID: `dodUUtwsqo09HrH2RO8w`) for all messages
4. Uses the default sender phone number `9295953158` for all outgoing voicemails
5. Validates recipient phone numbers automatically
6. Creates personalized messages including the recipient's name and property address
7. Maintains the same interface as the previous Make.com integration to ensure minimal changes to the rest of the application

### API Documentation

The VoiceDrop API for sending ringless voicemails requires:

- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.voicedrop.ai/v1/ringless_voicemail`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `auth-key: your_api_key_here`
- **Request Body**:
  - `voice_clone_id`: ID of the voice clone to use
  - `script`: Message that the recipient will receive
  - `from`: Sender phone number
  - `to`: Recipient US-based phone number
  - `validate_recipient_phone`: Boolean to enable validation
  - `send_status_to_webhook`: Optional webhook URL to receive status updates

### Next Steps for Improvement

To further enhance the integration, the following steps could be taken:

1. **Dynamic Voice Clones**: Allow selection of different voice clones for different types of messages
2. **Multiple Sender Numbers**: Implement rotation of sender phone numbers
3. **Webhook Integration**: Set up webhooks to receive delivery status updates
4. **Message Templates**: Create and manage reusable message templates
5. **Schedule Delivery**: Add ability to schedule voicemails for specific times
6. **Analytics**: Track delivery and response rates
7. **Environment Variables**: Move API keys and configuration to environment variables for better security
