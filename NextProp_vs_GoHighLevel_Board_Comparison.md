---

## 1. Core Architecture & Board Structure

### NextProp Current Implementation

**Technical Structure:**
- Implements a React-based Kanban-style board with stages represented as columns
- Uses `PipelineBoard` component (in `src/components/PipelineBoard.tsx`)
- State management appears to rely on React's useState hook
- Sample data structure:
  ```typescript
  interface PipelineStage {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    opportunities: Opportunity[];
    count: number;
    total: string;
  }

  interface PipelineData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    stages: PipelineStage[];
    totalOpportunities: number;
  }
  ```
- Limited scalability for handling large volumes of opportunities
- Potentially lacks optimizations for rendering efficiency with large datasets

**Visual Structure:**
- Basic column-based stage visualization
- Opportunity cards display properties like name, business name, and value
- Two view modes:
  - Grid view (Kanban-style cards in columns)
  - List view (tabular data presentation)
- Fixed column widths that may not adapt well to different content sizes
- No evident column resizing or customization options

**Data Flow:**
- Appears to use hardcoded sample data (`samplePipelines`)
- No evident integration with real-time data synchronization
- Potential performance limitations with larger datasets

### GoHighLevel Implementation

**Technical Structure:**
- Enterprise-grade pipeline architecture with distributed data model
- Multi-level hierarchical data structure supporting complex business workflows
- Likely uses a more sophisticated state management system (Redux or similar)
- Probable data structure (inferred):
  ```typescript
  interface Pipeline {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    stages: Stage[];
    metadata: {
      createdAt: Date;
      updatedAt: Date;
      owner: User;
      team: Team;
      settings: PipelineSettings;
    }
    customFields: CustomField[];
    totals: PipelineAnalytics;
  }
  ```
- Optimized for handling thousands of opportunities across multiple pipelines
- Likely implements virtualization for efficient rendering of large datasets

**Visual Structure:**
- Highly customizable column-based visualization
- Dynamic column sizing based on content and user preference
- Multiple view options:
  - Kanban board view with customizable card layouts
  - List view with configurable columns
  - Calendar view for time-sensitive opportunities
  - Gantt view for timeline-based project management
- Stage collapse/expand functionality to focus on specific parts of the pipeline
- Swimlanes support for categorizing opportunities horizontally across stages

**Data Flow:**
- Real-time data synchronization across users
- Optimistic UI updates with background synchronization
- Pagination and infinite scrolling for efficient data loading
- Caching mechanisms for improved performance
